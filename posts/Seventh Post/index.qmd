Week 7: Data

This week I learned about loading data onto R Studio and different ways to analyze the data. I practiced with the different coding functions on my tasks slide.

My goals for this week are:

1.  Read through the sources supplied to me and get a gist of data analysis on R Studio.
2.  To successfully install and display data from tidyverse and load it onto R Studio.
3.  Analyze the installed data using different coding functions from the resources Professor Crump supplied to me.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
starwars
glimpse(starwars)
?starwars
view(starwars)

ncol(starwars)
nrow(starwars)
dim(starwars)
dim(starwars)[1]
dim(starwars)[2]

ggplot(data=starwars, aes(x=height, y=mass))+ geom_point()

ggplot(data=starwars, aes(x=height, y=birth_year))+ geom_point()
```
