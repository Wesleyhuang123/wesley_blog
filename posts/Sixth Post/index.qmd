Week 6: Slides

This week I learned about creating a slides tab on my blog website and the numerous of other tools available to help me in editing those slides. I discussed with Professor Crump about the best approaches for me to take in creating a nice presentation and how to execute it efficiently on the day of the conference in December.

My goals for this week are:

1.  To create a format I want for my slides (Introduction, Research Question, Why It Matters, Research Method, Conclusion...etc)
2.  Play around with reveal js functions on R Studio and experiment different styles I can use to make my presentation more interesting.
