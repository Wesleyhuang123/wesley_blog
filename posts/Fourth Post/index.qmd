Week 4: Research

Upon coding and gathering information on the experiment, the first six participants were able to produce these results:

Our Data:

We were able to reproduce results similar to the original Ahmad (2019) experiment regarding directed forgetting. As indicated in the graph above for 500ms and 2000ms, we were able to find directed forgetting for both the exemplar and novel tests. Additionally, as expected people were more likely to get more correct and "remember" more during the novel test than the exemplar test because simply the novel test was designed to be easier to recognize previously seen images. However, the results of the exemplar test in the 2000ms appears to be considerably dramatic and the proportion correct between the "Forgetting" and "Remembering" in the exemplar test should close up as we get more results.

This is a good sign. Going forward, if we are able to continue to acquire similar results as we collect more data, then we can safely say that our changes to this experiment from the one that Patrick did were helpful in attempting to replicate the original results. We expect to collect results from 50 people.
