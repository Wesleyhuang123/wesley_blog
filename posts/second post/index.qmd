The concept of "R" language appears to be quite difficult starting from scratch and conquering it in a short amount of time seems to be a task out of reality. Despite all of this, I am eager to get to practice and improve in the craft of coding. By the end of this program, I hope that I will be well versed in learning more about coding from my mentor Professor Matt Crump and my peer Drew. I am excited about the upcoming tasks this semester and to seek the results from the experiments we will be conducting.

Some issues I have ran into my first week of learning to blog on RStudio are:

1.  How to create a new post with my own images (Personal or from the Internet)
2.  How to properly get my changes from RStudio onto github

Some goals I have for next week:

1.  I plan to personalize my own blog with either my own images or with some form of creativity that I can come up with.
2.  I plan to learn how to efficiently create new posts and get my changes onto RStudio.
3.  I look forward to the next steps in the research process and tasks my mentor may provide me to learn more about coding.
