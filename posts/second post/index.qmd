Week 3: Directed Forgetting Paper Thoughts

It was interesting to know that through each experiments the researchers were able to produce results that indicate that a directed forgetting reduces memory for perceptual details of pictures. I liked how each experiment, the researchers were trying to build on possible errors to disprove in the previous experiments. For example, adding the control condition in experiment 3 where participants were simply told to remember all the study items for a later recognition test. Doing so can more accurately test the item-based directed forgetting because R-cued items in the DF experimental condition would be greater than memory performance for the items in the remember-all control condition. 

In my opinion, I think that the exemplar distractors produced their results because the images were very similar to the original ones from their categories. This probably led to the longer response times and the less portion of accuracy that were correct compared to the Novel Test. I also think that a key detail to note is that the researchers took different participants each time for each experiment. Each participant may have had a different skill set that could have affect the results, however by choosing different participants we can guarantee that each different experiment had results based on participants who were taking the memory tests fresh each time and not getting better from experiment to experiment.


Thoughts and Feedback on New Experiment:
The images were flashing too quickly in the beginning that there was no time to pick up on perceptual details of an image. It was difficult to purposely remember/forget certain images. Additionally, at a specific time during the encoding phase (towards the middle and the end), it was difficult to keep my attention span on the test. At a certain point it felt tedious and it was difficult to make the decision to purposely remember or forget certain images. However, I felt like the exemplar distractor did make me have to think more before selecting an image during the memory test, where during the novel test without the distractors it was more easy for me to select the obvious image I saw previously. Overall, I think that the attention span is the most difficult to overcome to make the results of the experiment as accurate as possible
