Week 5: Directed Forgetting Paper

Through the early history (Brown (1954), Muther (1965), Bjork (1972) ) of the memory experiments, the name "directed forgetting" was agreed upon by researchers for future experiments and data added onto the research. I wonder how this name came to be and what was the purpose behind the directed forgetting experiments. What results were we looking for and how did these results help us better understand cognition or improve the real world? I found it particularly interesting that Muther (1965) was able to find results that supported better recall on a list where 12 words were to be remembered, and 12 words were to be forgotten than a list where all 24 words had to be remembered. He explained these results to be due to a lowered attentional demand, reduced proactive interference, more focused rehearsal, and easier organization. We can relate this to the data we received in our novel/exemplar directed forgetting test for the first 6 participants. One important thing to note is that through the history of these experiments, the researchers often built upon research already done in the past without making big changes. This is something we did in our current experiment. Another important thing to note is that David Helms (1969) found that the F cue must be distinctive and explicit usage of the word "forget" appears to make a difference. This was done in our revised experiment from the original Patrick study where we only used F and R keys, now we explicitly use the words "Forget" or "Remember" and have a rating system in place that we can attribute to a better/more accurate results of directed forgetting. Initially, I thought that recognition would be better than recall since the act of recognizing something takes less cognitive skills than recalling something from your memory. However, in the paper studies have shown the opposite. Recall was found to be often more accurate than recognition. This is something that sparks interest in me and I wonder why this is the case.
