Week 9: Exploring jsPsych

As a prospective psychology major student still new to coding and taking the next step to explore how to create experiments, my initial impression of jsPsych is that is is quite confusing. However, I believe with the proper guidance from Professor Crump, I will be able to be put on a good track for my independent research this semester. Here are a few of my documented curiosities as I am going through the website:

1.  I read that to edit jsPsych code, I need a programming-friendly text editor like "Visual Studi Code on windows, OSX, Linux). I was wondering what I need to specifically download and will I be working inside R Studio(for writing the code for the experiments)?
2.  I checked the video tutorials tab, but are there specific YouTube channels or do you have your own personal video tutorials of jsPsych?

After trying out the basics, it is now time for on hands learning. I attempted to recreate the simple reaction time task demo experiment. In my attempt to do so, I found that the jsPsych code functions may be different from the functions of R-Studio as is the same for other programs like Javascript or snapcode. Therefore, the written code cannot be executed in R-Studio. I have tried to download another code editing program called the "Visual Studio Editor". I will await for instructions from Professor Crump on how to set up jsPsych for the rest of the semester to run smoothly.
