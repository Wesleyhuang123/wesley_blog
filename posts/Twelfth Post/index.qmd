Hick- Hyman Experiment:

Hick's Law states that the amount of time to make a decision increases as there are more choices to make. It measures one's ability to make decisions in different amounts of uncertainty. Important definitions to note: 1. Reaction Time- time between onset of a stimulus and the start of a response 2. Movement Time- the time it takes to complete an onset of a movement 3. Response Time- the time it takes to process information and then make a response

Cool fact: Taller people have a slower reaction time than shorter people because of distance.

Hick created an equation to calculate reaction time: RT= MT + processing speed \* log2(n) (Reaction time is equal to movement time plus processing speed times log2(amount of choices)) Professor Crump and I will be recreating several experiments using Hick-Hyman's idea in mind.
