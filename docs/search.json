    "text": "Week 3: Directed Forgetting Paper Thoughts\nIt was interesting to know that through each experiments the researchers were able to produce results that indicate that a directed forgetting reduces memory for perceptual details of pictures. I liked how each experiment, the researchers were trying to build on possible errors to disprove in the previous experiments. For example, adding the control condition in experiment 3 where participants were simply told to remember all the study items for a later recognition test. Doing so can more accurately test the item-based directed forgetting because R-cued items in the DF experimental condition would be greater than memory performance for the items in the remember-all control condition.\nIn my opinion, I think that the exemplar distractors produced their results because the images were very similar to the original ones from their categories. This probably led to the longer response times and the less portion of accuracy that were correct compared to the Novel Test. I also think that a key detail to note is that the researchers took different participants each time for each experiment. Each participant may have had a different skill set that could have affect the results, however by choosing different participants we can guarantee that each different experiment had results based on participants who were taking the memory tests fresh each time and not getting better from experiment to experiment.\nThoughts and Feedback on New Experiment: The images were flashing too quickly in the beginning that there was no time to pick up on perceptual details of an image. It was difficult to purposely remember/forget certain images. Additionally, at a specific time during the encoding phase (towards the middle and the end), it was difficult to keep my attention span on the test. At a certain point it felt tedious and it was difficult to make the decision to purposely remember or forget certain images. However, I felt like the exemplar distractor did make me have to think more before selecting an image during the memory test, where during the novel test without the distractors it was more easy for me to select the obvious image I saw previously. Overall, I think that the attention span is the most difficult to overcome to make the results of the experiment as accurate as possible"

    "text": "Week 2: Coding\nThis week I was able to figure out how to code problems 1,2, and 4 on my own. I found problems 3 to 5 a bit challenging but after watching Professor Crump’s videos I was able to figure it out. Professor Crump does a great job at breaking down each function and explaining how the code is executed. However, problem 6 seemed to be the most challenging for me and I got lost trying to follow the code executed.\nAnother problem I ran into was trying to change my image on my second blog post to a photo I found from google. It was a jpeg file and I am not entirely aware of how to do that. I tried images/(name).jpeg but it did not work. Hopefully, I can figure this out with my next meeting with the Professor.\nMy goals for next week are to continue with the practice problems."

    "text": "The concept of “R” language appears to be quite difficult starting from scratch and conquering it in a short amount of time seems to be a task out of reality. Despite all of this, I am eager to get to practice and improve in the craft of coding. By the end of this program, I hope that I will be well versed in learning more about coding from my mentor Professor Matt Crump and my peer Drew. I am excited about the upcoming tasks this semester and to seek the results from the experiments we will be conducting.\nSome issues I have ran into my first week of learning to blog on RStudio are:\n\nHow to create a new post with my own images (Personal or from the Internet)\nHow to properly get my changes from RStudio onto github\n\nSome goals I have for next week:\n\nI plan to personalize my own blog with either my own images or with some form of creativity that I can come up with.\nI plan to learn how to efficiently create new posts and get my changes onto RStudio.\nI look forward to the next steps in the research process and tasks my mentor may provide me to learn more about coding."

    "text": "Upon coding and gathering information on the experiment, the first six participants were able to produce these results:\nOur Data:\n\nWe were able to reproduce results similar to the original Ahmad (2019) experiment regarding directed forgetting. As indicated in the graph above for 500ms and 2000ms, we were able to find directed forgetting for both the exemplar and novel tests. Additionally, as expected people were more likely to get more correct and “remember” more during the novel test than the exemplar test because simply the novel test was designed to be easier to recognize previously seen images. However, the results of the exemplar test in the 2000ms appears to be considerably dramatic and the proportion correct between the “Forgetting” and “Remembering” in the exemplar test should close up as we get more results.\nThis is a good sign. Going forward, if we are able to continue to acquire similar results as we collect more data, then we can safely say that our changes to this experiment from the one that Patrick did were helpful in attempting to replicate the original results. We expect to collect results from 50 people."
