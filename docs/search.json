    "text": "Week 2 of learning to code:\nThis week I was able to figure out how to code problems 1,2, and 4 on my own. I found problems 3 to 5 a bit challenging but after watching Professor Crump’s videos I was able to figure it out. Professor Crump does a great job at breaking down each function and explaining how the code is executed. However, problem 6 seemed to be the most challenging for me and I got lost trying to follow the code executed.\nAnother problem I ran into was trying to change my image on my second blog post to a photo I found from google. It was a jpeg file and I am not entirely aware of how to do that. I tried images/(name).jpeg but it did not work. Hopefully, I can figure this out with my next meeting with the Professor.\nMy goals for next week are to continue with the practice problems."

    "text": "The concept of “R” language appears to be quite difficult starting from scratch and conquering it in a short amount of time seems to be a task out of reality. Despite all of this, I am eager to get to practice and improve in the craft of coding. By the end of this program, I hope that I will be well versed in learning more about coding from my mentor Professor Matt Crump and my peer Drew. I am excited about the upcoming tasks this semester and to seek the results from the experiments we will be conducting.\nSome issues I have ran into my first week of learning to blog on RStudio are:\n\nHow to create a new post with my own images (Personal or from the Internet)\nHow to properly get my changes from RStudio onto github\n\nSome goals I have for next week:\n\nI plan to personalize my own blog with either my own images or with some form of creativity that I can come up with.\nI plan to learn how to efficiently create new posts and get my changes onto RStudio.\nI look forward to the next steps in the research process and tasks my mentor may provide me to learn more about coding."
